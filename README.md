# Medico - Landing Page

It's a Medical Landing Website converted from Figma to mobile friendly responsive website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The main goal of building this website is learning and becoming the master of web development.

There was a lot to learn while building this website. When we build a website first we setup our style guide to match the website theme, and this was my initial step. Second step was creating reusable components, and using those components creating template/sections and then pages.
